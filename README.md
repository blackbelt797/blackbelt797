### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Gregg Cline

I'm from California. I have a a great passion for all technology. I'm constantly tinkering with a variety of things. I'm currently a Land Surveyor/Photogrammitrist and a freelance Front End Developer. Right now my primary focusing is on Font End. 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue.js are the Languages/ Frame Works I am currently most familiar with.

#Goals: Develope my Front End Skills then Back End skills to become well rounded.
